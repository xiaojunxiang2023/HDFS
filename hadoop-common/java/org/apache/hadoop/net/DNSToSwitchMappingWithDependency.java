   * Get a list of dependent DNS-names for a given DNS-name/IP-address.
   * Dependent DNS-names fall into the same fault domain which must be
   * taken into account when placing replicas. This is intended to be used for
   * cross node group dependencies when node groups are not sufficient to 
   * distinguish data nodes by fault domains. In practice, this is needed when
   * a compute server runs VMs which use shared storage (as opposite to 
   * directly attached storage). In this case data nodes fall in two different
   * fault domains. One fault domain is defined by a compute server and 
   * the other is defined by storage. With node groups we can group data nodes
   * either by server fault domain or by storage fault domain. However one of
   * the fault domains cannot be handled and there we need to define cross node
   * group dependencies. These dependencies are applied in block placement 
   * polices which ensure that no two replicas will be on two dependent nodes. 
   * @param name - host name or IP address of a data node. Input host name 
   * parameter must take a value of dfs.datanode.hostname config value if this
   * config property is set. Otherwise FQDN of the data node is used.
   * @return list of dependent host names. If dfs.datanode.hostname config
   * property is set, then its value must be returned.
   * Otherwise, FQDN is returned.
