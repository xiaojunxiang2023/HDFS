/**
 * This is a span created by an {@link AuditSpanSource}.
 * An implementation of a span may carry context which can be picked
 * up by the filesystem when activated.
 * Each FS can have one active span per thread.
 * Different filesystem instances SHALL have different active
 * spans (if they support them)
 * A span is activated in a thread when {@link #activate()}
 * is called.
 * The span stays active in that thread until {@link #deactivate()}
 * is called.
 * When deactivated in one thread, it MAY still be active in others.
 * There's no explicit "end of span"; this is too hard to manage in
 * terms of API lifecycle.
 * Similarly, there's no stack of spans. Once a span is activated,
 * the previous span is forgotten about.
 * Therefore each FS will need a fallback "inactive span" which
 * will be reverted to on deactivation of any other span.
