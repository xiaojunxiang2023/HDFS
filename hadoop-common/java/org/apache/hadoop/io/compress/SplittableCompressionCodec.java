/**
 * This interface is meant to be implemented by those compression codecs
 * which are capable to compress / de-compress a stream starting at any
 * arbitrary position.
 *
 * Especially the process of de-compressing a stream starting at some arbitrary
 * position is challenging.  Most of the codecs are only able to successfully
 * de-compress a stream, if they start from the very beginning till the end.
 * One of the reasons is the stored state at the beginning of the stream which
 * is crucial for de-compression.
 *
 * Yet there are few codecs which do not save the whole state at the beginning
 * of the stream and hence can be used to de-compress stream starting at any
 * arbitrary points.  This interface is meant to be used by such codecs.  Such
 * codecs are highly valuable, especially in the context of Hadoop, because
 * an input compressed file can be split and hence can be worked on by multiple
 * machines in parallel.
